A music player for Android that hits the basics hard

This is a fork of the PrettyGoodMusicPlayer app developed by smithdtyler. Huge shoutout to him to making one simple app that enabled me to boost development on my own app, and thus I am creating a player that sort of cleans up the interface, does some fixes and such. To be honest, I'd be telling whoever that visits this forked repo of mine not to expect any sort of stellar code or such. I'm just creating a base for my tinkering with audio on Android. If you still find something of value, well, cheers!
